## About

A web app used for searching disks' covers from iTunes, Amazon, Netease Music, etc.

All results are picked from [Google Images](https://images.google.com). In fact, it's just a [reverse proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) of the search results of "`your-key-words site:itunes.apple.com/us`" or `"your-key-words site:amazone.com`".

This app's name is inspired by a track which is composed by Yuki Kajiura and has a same name.
